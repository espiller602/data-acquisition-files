# data-acquisition-files
Make sure when running the code, the files are in the same directory as the code notebook. If you want to add different years, add the files to the folder and change the ranges used in the code. Make sure all files are named using the same conventions, so the season offensive metrics should be formatted as "team-offense-XXXX.xls" and the postseason data should be formatted as "XXX-postseason-teams.xls". Pro-football-reference stores all the data as HTML tables in the xls, not as an actual xls file properly. I don't know why this is but that's how PFR does it.
